#Congratulations! 

You have reached the first night of the Data Analysis section of this class. Now that you have a grasp of the basics of the Python programming language (and if you don't, please reach out!), we can begin using that knowledge to leverage Python to work with large sets of data. 

Soon you will be well-prepared to take a set of data and turn it into a mind-blowing masterpiece of graphs and charts and communicate your findings. We'll be getting to the meat and potatoes of data analysis with Python a bit later, but first we need to discuss some basic fundamentals.

#Data Analysis Workflow

What are we going to learn in this section of the class? In what order? How do data scientists even approach their task? Well, over time an **iterative** process has been established. (Bonus: Can you tell me what 'iterative' means?) 

This process involves collecting data, preparing it, exploratory data analysis, and drawing conclusions. 

Let's look at what that process can look like:

Keep in mind, the process is heavily-based in data preparation and determining if the outcome of the step you took to wrangle the data meets expectations. 

1. Set expectations
2. Collect data/info - compare expectations to reality
3. React to data and revise expectations if needed - What have we learned? What would we do differently next time? 

Repeat if necessary!

##Data Collection

There is no shortage of data in today's world. Shopping habits. Consumer info. Data from restaurant POS. Sports stats. Traffic studies. Population. Wall Street stocks. 

Data collection is a must-have first step as we cannot analyze data we do not have. But first we need to consider a few things:
1. What kind of data do we need? 
	Data that is useful for our analysis. 
2. Where will we get it?
	- Web scraping
	- APIs
	- Databases
	- Government websites
	- Financial resources
	- Log files

Remember we are looking for data relevant to our study. If we are looking for speeds of cars, do we need to know the cars' colors? No, but relevant data might be the terrain type or weather conditions or type of fuel used. The data you use will depend on the story you are trying to tell. 

##Data Wrangling

But what if the data we gather isn't perfect? No worries.
