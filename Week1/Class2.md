# NumPy, continued.

## Warmup

We left off talking about the advantages of numpy lists, and tonight we will delve into them further. But let's make sure you have the hang of creating a Numpy ndarray. 

Given the list:

```
temps = [34.5, 65.3, 23.4, 65.0, 99.3, 96.3, 23.4, 54.2]
```

Create a one-dimensional numpy array.
How many axes does this array have? What is the length?
