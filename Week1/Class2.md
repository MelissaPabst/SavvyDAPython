# NumPy, continued.

## Warmup

We left off talking about the advantages of numpy ndarrays, and tonight we will delve into them further. But let's make sure you have the hang of creating a Numpy ndarray. 

Given the following, create a numpy array:

```
temps = [[[34.5, 65.3], [23.4, 65.0], [99.3, 96.3]],  [[23.4, 54.2], [32.4, 34.2], [12.4, 56.4]]]
```

Create numpy array.
What are its attributes? ndim? shape? size? dtype?
