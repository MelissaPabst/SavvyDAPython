We're switching gears a bit; NumPy taught us how to do math with ndarrays of single-type data (homogenous) efficiently, and next on our agenda is **pandas**. Pandas is another library for Python and is built on top of NumPy. Pandas is better suited for data of heterogenous types, and data in tables, or **dataframes**, as they call them in pandas. 

Remember MatPlotLib? Well, pandas provides **wrappers** around the matplotlib library, reducing the lines of code needed to use matploblib code. You may recall from your lesson on object-oriented programming the concept of **abstraction**, which aims to hide the bits that aren't needed, effectively reducing the complexity and therefore the lines of code. Well, that's what a wrapper does. You don't need to know how your coffee pot works, but that you can get some hot bean juice if you do x, y, and z steps. A wrapper class is like the buttons on the coffee pot. 

Why is it called pandas? I don't mean to de-mystify it, and you can continue to picture in your mind cute little pandas typing away in your computer, but it comes from *panel data*, an econometrics term you don't hear a lot and is the term for multidimensional structured datasets.
